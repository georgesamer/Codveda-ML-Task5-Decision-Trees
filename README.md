# Codveda-ML-Task5-Decision-Trees
A Python project implementing a Decision Tree Classifier on the Iris dataset using scikit-learn. The code includes training, cross-validation, evaluation with accuracy and F1-score, and visualization of the tree. Tools: Python, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn.
# Decision Tree Classifier - Iris Dataset ðŸŒ±

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a **Decision Tree Classifier** using the Iris dataset.  
It covers training, visualization, pruning, and evaluation with multiple metrics.

## Features
- Train a decision tree on the Iris dataset
- Visualize the decision tree structure
- Perform cross-validation for reliable evaluation
- Measure performance with **Accuracy** and **F1-score**
- Prevent overfitting using pruning parameters

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/decision-tree-iris.git
   cd decision-tree-iris
